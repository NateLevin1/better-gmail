## FAQ
### Remapping deleting isn't working. How can I fix this?
If remapping isn't working, you first have to make sure that you have keyboard shortcuts enabled. In Gmail, go to settings -> see all settings -> advanced, then scroll down to "Custom keyboard Shortcuts." Click "enable"

If you have done this and it still does not work, go to the Gmail home screen, on your keyboard press the `?` key (shift+`/`), then at the bottom click on the yellow underlined word that says "enable"
